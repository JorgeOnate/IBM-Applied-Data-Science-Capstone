## Introduction

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; 
other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because 
SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, 
we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate 
company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
